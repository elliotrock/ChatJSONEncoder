# ChatJSONEncoder
ChatJSONEncoder encodes @mentions, emoticon (coffee) and it returns the url title as a JSONString. The console shows logs of the result.  


The project uses cocoapods to manage dependencies. To install via command line if they haven't:

sudo gem install cocoapods

Inside the directory where they clone the project to in the main build folder (where the podfile lives), via command line:

pods update

Once the dependencies have been updated open the project via the ChatJSONEncoder.xcworkspace file not the stock .xcodeproj
